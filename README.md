Business Objective: 
  Telecom Industry are concerned about the market environment of rising churn rates and declining ARPU (Average revenue per Unit) will hit them hard, as churn rate at the company is relatively high. Based customer behavior and db had to predict the customer churn rate, segment and target customers.
  
Solution: 
  Step1: Data sanitizing, Outliers treatment, profiling of each variable, impute missing values and Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) 
Step2: Logistic regression model using backward selection algorithm and validation of models and selected a best fit model by keeping only significant variables. 
Step3: Predicted Churn rate for each customer & Target segments of customers.

Conclusion: 
  The confusion matrix is used to review the prediction vs actual. It is important to note that while the accuracy of the model appears to be high, lot of that accuracy is driven by disproportionate number of non churn customers predicted correctly.
